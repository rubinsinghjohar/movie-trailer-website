Hello Udacity Graders! To run my program please perform the followings steps:

1. Extract 'project one' to your favorite location
2. cd into that directory from Terminal
3. Run the python interpreter ('python')
4. Type in: 'from fresh_tomatoes import *' (this will provide us all of the functions as well as the dependencies that are required to run the program)
5. Type in: 'print movies' and you should see three object references to media.movie inside of a list
6. Type in: 'open_movies_page(movies)' and this should create a new web browser window and point to a newly created fresh_tomatoes.html file with three movies:
   1. Speed 1
   2. Who Framed Roger Rabbit
   3. Hot Tub Time Machine 1
7. Click on any of the cover art to watch the trailer for that movie
